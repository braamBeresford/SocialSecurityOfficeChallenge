# SS Challenge

This started as a way to resolve discussion in the office around the Equifax breach and how big of a TXT we would need to hold the 130 Million lost records. It spiraled into who could write the fastest executable for generating 130 million records with these parameters.

#### Requirements:
- Name of random length between 8-12 and random letters
- Social of random 9 digits
- Written out to TXT
- No other rules
